### New Feature: xxxx

- xxx

### Stock

- Optimized the line plot markers color of the price history chart (product card) (thanks @DeepCoreSystem)
- Fixed that German Umlauts were removed from product names when looking up a barcode via the built-in Open Food Facts external barcode lookup plugin
- Fixed that when using/scanning a barcode on the purchase page with a note attached (which prefills the note field) and when manually selecting another product afterwards, the note of the previously used barcode was incorrectly prefilled again

### Shopping list

- An amount of `0` is now allowed for shopping list items (just a convenience optimization, it was already possible to leave the amount field empty which implicitly resulted in an amount of `0`)
- Fixed that the "Add all list items to stock" workflow closed the dialog after every item instead only after the last one was added
